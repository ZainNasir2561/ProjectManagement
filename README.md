# ProjectManagement

This project was a real test of my understanding of React hooks specifically useState, useRef and forwardRef. 

This project was designed to utiliza performance allowing for a smooth user experience. 

Within this project, I also incorporated TailwindCSS to familiarize myself up-to-date syntaxes.


If you would like to run this code, simple use

npm install and npm run dev
